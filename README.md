# Turbo Task Management

A TypeScript task-management monorepo with an Angular web app and a NestJS API.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: an [Angular](https://angular.dev/) app
- `api`: a [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) app
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/types`: shared types for the monorepo
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended):

```sh
cd my-turborepo
turbo build
```

Without global `turbo`, use your package manager:

```sh
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo build
pnpm dlx turbo build
pnpm exec turbo build
```

You can build a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.dev/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed:

```sh
turbo build --filter=docs
```

Without global `turbo`:

```sh
npx turbo build --filter=docs
pnpm exec turbo build --filter=docs
pnpm exec turbo build --filter=docs
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended):

```sh
cd my-turborepo
turbo dev
```

Without global `turbo`, use your package manager:

```sh
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo dev
pnpm exec turbo dev
pnpm exec turbo dev
```

You can develop a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.dev/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed:

```sh
turbo dev --filter=web
```

Without global `turbo`:

```sh
npx turbo dev --filter=web
pnpm exec turbo dev --filter=web
pnpm exec turbo dev --filter=web
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.dev/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended):

```sh
cd my-turborepo
turbo login
```

Without global `turbo`, use your package manager:

```sh
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
pnpm exec turbo login
pnpm exec turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed:

```sh
turbo link
```

Without global `turbo`:

```sh
npx turbo link
pnpm exec turbo link
pnpm exec turbo link
```

## CI

This repository includes a GitHub Actions CI workflow. It runs linting, tests, and builds with Turborepo:

- for pull requests targeting `main`;
- for pushes to `main`.

The workflow uses Vercel Remote Cache when the required repository secrets are configured.

## Configure Vercel Remote Cache for CI

The CI workflow reads `TURBO_TOKEN` and `TURBO_TEAM` from GitHub Actions secrets.

1. In the Vercel Dashboard, select an existing team or create one from the team switcher. This is the team that will share the remote cache.
2. With that team selected, note its slug from the dashboard URL (for example, `vercel.com/acme/...`). Use this slug as `TURBO_TEAM`.
3. Switch to your personal Vercel account, then open **Settings** > **Tokens** and select **Create Token**. Scope the token to the chosen team and copy it immediately; Vercel will not show it again.
4. In the GitHub repository, open **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** > **New repository secret**, then add:

   | Secret        | Value                                 |
   | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
   | `TURBO_TOKEN` | The Vercel access token created above |
   | `TURBO_TEAM`  | The selected Vercel team's slug       |

After both secrets are saved, GitHub Actions passes them to Turborepo and CI can share cached task artifacts with the team.
